# Experimenting With DALL-E

[DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) provides an API to generate impressively accurate [images](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction) from given a description. It is not only limited to image generations as it also provides other APIs to generate text and code given a user prompt.

An example of image generation using DALL-E preview [application](https://labs.openai.com/) using the prompt `tinkering with dall-e` is given below. The more precise the description, the more accurate is the generation of the images. You can also create variations from the originally generated images.
