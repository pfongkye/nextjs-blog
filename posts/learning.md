# The process of learning

There are some techniques that can be used to learn things efficiently and that can help in your daily activities (for me software development). It can be a combination of the following:
- learn broadly to be able to have different techniques (as a french expression says it well "Avoir plusieurs cordes Ã  son arc") and to know which technique to apply for a given context.
- have a [frequency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_list) to learn the core concepts. Deep dive into the core concepts that come up more frequently.
- explain in simple non technical words the concepts as though it's been explained to a child ([Feynman technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching#Plastic_platypus_learning)).
- use [pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) to help get into a focused/diffuse mode.
- focus on what matters to your daily activities and do not get distracted by the wealth of information available. If it's important/relevant it will come back.
- use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) so that the concepts stick.
