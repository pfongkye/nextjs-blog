# Lighthouse CI

This [guideline](https://web.dev/lighthouse-ci/) helps in setting up [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci), which is a set of tools for performance monitoring.

The guideline walks us through the different steps needed to run Lighthouse CI locally, then in a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions). 

An example of project using a Lighthouse configuration and GitHub actions can be found [here](https://github.com/pfongkye/nextjs-blog).
