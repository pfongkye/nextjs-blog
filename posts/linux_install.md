# Linux Installation

I don't remember the last time I installed an operating system on a computer. What I remembered though is that I struggled with installing
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) at that time (which either means it was a long time ago or I was very new to IT, or both).

I have an old laptop that has started to collect dust and was very slow since its update to [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10).
I decided to make a fresh install of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#1-getting-started) on it to see how it behaves.
The following are the different steps I took to install the OS:
- Create a bootable USB using [Rufus](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) on Windows.
- Use the latest stable version of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#download) as image for Rufus.
- Plug USB on old laptop.
- Restart computer and configure boot options (HP: tap F10 and change order of boot, save and exit).
- Follow installation instructions.

The installation completed without any issues. Although the laptop takes a quite long time to boot, it seems to run smooth enough for its age.
