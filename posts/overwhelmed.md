# Overwhelmed

It is very hard sometimes to cope with the feeling of being overwhelmed, particularly in the current situation of COVID-19 where extra stress is added.

Below are some tips that I find helpful in finding ways in mitigating this feeling:

- Be intentional in creating your physical and digital space
- Speed up your developer inner loop by finding patterns and by automating as much as possible
- Improve your skills by doing katas, coding challenges
- Use pomodoro technique
- Taking steps back sometimes help in reconsidering the situation when being stuck
- Keep a digital garden
- Do exercices regularly (even walking for 20 minutes helps)
- Have a good sleep
- Meditate
- Take time doing other things
- Take time with family
